# Hardhat Found Me

This code demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

First, check this great [FCC course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=36048s).

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
